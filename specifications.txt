localization
    localized text content can be found at src/main/resources/public/i18n
    every .html page has a localization .json with matching name
        .json structure
            {
                "title": "Title of the page",
                "staticText": {
                    "id-of-the-html-tag": [
                        {
                            "key": "attribute"
                            "message": "Value of the attribute"
                        }
                    ]
                },
                "additionalContent": {
                    "id": "Additional contents are used by JS for several case, eg. notifications, or not static content's labels"
                }
            }
    additional localization files:
        message_codes.json: stores notification/error messages
        categories.json: stores names of factory/shop categories
        description.json: localization used for ship's / item's description
        items.json: contains names and descriptions of all items can be used in game
            items' data is stored at src/main/resources/public/gamedata/items

    Only Hungarian localization is present yet.
    To determinate the localization, application uses the browser's language.
    FE tries to load localization from the server with this language, and if localization not found, it falls back to Hungarian.
